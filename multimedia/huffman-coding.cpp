1. Create a program that uses pointers to swap the values of two integers. The program should ask the user to input two integers, swap their values using pointers, and display the swapped values.

2. Create an array of integers with at least 5 elements. Write a program that uses pointers to find the sum and average of the elements in the array. The program should display the sum and average.

Sample input:
[3, 6, 9, 12, 15]

Sample output:
Sum: 45
Average: 9

3. Create a program that uses pointers to find the largest and smallest values in an array of integers. The program should ask the user to input the array elements, find the largest and smallest values using pointers, and display them.

Sample input:
Enter array elements: 5 8 2 10 7

Sample output:
Largest value: 10
Smallest value: 2

4. Create an array of integers with at least 7 elements. Write a program that uses pointers to remove all even values from the array. The program should display the new array without the even values.

Sample input:
[2, 5, 8, 11, 12, 15, 18]

Sample output:
New array: [5, 11, 15]

5. Create a program that uses pointers to sort an array of integers in ascending order. The program should ask the user to input the array elements, sort them using pointers, and display the sorted array.

Sample input:
Enter array elements: 9 2 7 4 11

Sample output:
Sorted array: [2, 4, 7, 9, 11]
