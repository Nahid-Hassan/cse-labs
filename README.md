### Computer Science and Engineering Dept. Lab Solutions - University of Rajshahi

In this repository I am trying to contribute my **3rd** year and **4th** year lab solutions with documentation. I am not guaranteed that all the code is **BUG** free. If you follow my code, it is your responsibility ðŸ˜´. 

Some of the resource links are added in the various `README.md` documentation files in different directories. I want to give all of you very, very special, thanks. You all are awesome. 

Most of the time I feel, I am ðŸ˜‘ðŸ™‡ and also my works. But when I see it helps others my feelings ....ðŸ˜‡.... Thanks for visiting my repository.
